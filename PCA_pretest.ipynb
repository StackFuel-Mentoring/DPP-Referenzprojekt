    "Behind the flight number is a specific aircraft type with a specific kerosene consumption. Kerosene prices have an impact on flight prices. Kerosene consumption also depends on the flight altitude and speed.\n",

    "The aircraft types, altitude and speed can be read out e.g. via flightaware.com. Information on average kerosene consumption can then also be read from the aircraft types.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the flight altitude and speed are standardized for each flight, this information is contained in the flight numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is used here as an attempt to retain the flight numbers with the information hidden in them and to reduce the number of columns for model training."
